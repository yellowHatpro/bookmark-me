# Bookmark-me
Bookmarks from everywhere just got better (kidding. No one's gonna use this, it's another "oh I got a new idea" app)

BTW it's a one-stop solution to all bookmarks, 

## Impl
- Currently, my nub mind thinks:
  - Create a db and object storage to store user, and bookmarks
  - A node server to handle bookmark requests

## TODO
1. Topics: Different topics so that user 
2. Frontend/TUI/GUI/Extension
3. Python workers: to scrape bookmarks from different social media sites, like LinkedIn, Twitter, keep notes(?), and other relevant sites
